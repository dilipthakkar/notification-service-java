# Real-Time Communication POC Project

This project demonstrates different real-time communication techniques implemented using Spring Boot. It consists of three sub-projects, each showcasing a different approach:

1. [Server Sent Events](./server-sent-events/README.md): This sub-project demonstrates the usage of server-sent events (SSE) in a Spring Boot application. SSE allows the server to push real-time updates to clients over a single HTTP connection.

2. [Websockets](./websockets/README.md): This sub-project showcases the usage of WebSockets in a Spring Boot application. WebSockets enable bidirectional communication between the server and clients, allowing real-time data exchange.

3. [Client Polling](./client-polling/README.md): This sub-project implements client-side polling in a Spring Boot application. Client polling involves clients periodically requesting updates from the server at regular intervals.

## Getting Started

To run any of the sub-projects locally, follow the specific instructions provided in each sub-project's README file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request in the respective sub-project repository.
